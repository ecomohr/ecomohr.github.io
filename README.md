## Welcome!

Hi, I'm Eknoor Kaur. I live in the bay area and currently work remotely as a software engineer. Some of the things I enjoy most are watching and supporting the Golden State Warriors, reading, exploring nature, traveling, writing, and hanging out with friends & family!

### Passions

I have always been very passionate about the power of education and as such love tutoring, mentoring, and/or coaching in any capacity that I can!
